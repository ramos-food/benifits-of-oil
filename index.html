               <p>Why care about the benefits of essential oils? What are essential oils? and how can they help you? Why is it worthwhile to make a habit of using essential oils for your healthy living needs?</p>
               <p>If you are thinking about creating a habit of using essential oils, this post gives you all the information you need to make informed decisions about essential oils, aromatherapy and what benefits of essential oils may be right for you.</p>
               <p>Pharmaceutical drugs have dangerous side effects. These side effects can cause serious bodily harm. </p>
               <p>More-and-more people are turning to more natural & holistic approaches to health. By using natural remedies to heal ourselves we can be free of the worries of unwanted side effects.</p>
               <p>One of the safest and most effective forms of alternative medicines is aromatherapy.</p>
               <p>Aromatherapy uses plant-based essential oils to provide the mind and body with numerous health benefits. These oils are typically inexpensive and free of harmful side effects.  Even better, they work very quickly as the oils get absorbed through the skin and lungs.</p>
               <h3>What Is Aromatherapy?</h3>
               <p>Aromatherapy is the use of aromatic essential oils derived from plants for the purpose of enhancing the well-being of one's physical or psychological health. Aromatherapy has been used for centuries as an alternative medicine that safely and effectively treats numerous ailments.</p>
               <p>To create essential oils, the natural oils in certain plants are extracted and distilled, resulting in an extremely concentrated product packed with healing benefits.</p>
               <p>Essential oils used in aromatherapy trigger responses in the brain that send healing to the body. These oils can balance out hormone levels, heal digestive disorders, and dramatically reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>
               <p>Scientific studies have shown that aromatherapy is a completely legitimate form of medicine. By inhaling essential oils, nerves in the nose trigger powerful brain responses. Similarly, topical application allows these essential oils to quickly enter the bloodstream by being absorbed through skin tissue.</p>
               <p>When selecting essential oils, it is important to look for pure and natural products. Oils that contain synthetic chemicals and dyes will not be nearly as effective.</p>
               <h3>How Can Essential Oils Be Applied?</h3>
               <p>Aromatherapy can be applied in many different ways depending on the condition that you want to address.</p>
               <p>Topical use of essential oils is very effective in treating skin ailments and mood disorders.</p>
               <p>Some essential oils are highly beneficial when ingested. For instance, by swallowing peppermint essential oil, you can relieve gas and stomach cramps. Some essential oils can even be used as flavoring agents that offer nutritional value, such as lemon essential oil, which adds flavor to water while providing the body with vitamin C.</p>
               <p>If you are using aromatherapy to address a psychological imbalance such as stress, depression, or anxiety you may wonder how an oil can effect your brain?</p>
               <p>Essential oils for anxiety and other brain imbalances are delivered through diffuser or a hot bath. By simply breathing the oil in, you will receive the benefits that this oil can offer on a psychological level.</p>
               <p>These scents work in two methods. First, smell is a powerful sense. pleasant smells can remind us of good times and relieve nerves, stress and anxiety. Second the chemicals inhaled actually enter the bloodstream and can help balance hormone levels.</p>
               <p>The best (and most popular) method for using these oils is the diffuser. You can find our review of the best essential oil diffusers here.</p>
               <p>When applying essential oils topically, some oils require a carrier oil. For example, tea tree oil is highly effective in treating fungal infections and inflammation, but may be mildly irritating to more sensitive areas of the skin such as the eye area and the genitals. In this case, a carrier oil may be required.</p>
               <h3>What Is a Carrier Oil?</h3>
               <p>A carrier oil is an oil in which the essential oil can be diluted. By diluting your essential oil in a carrier oil, it may then easily be applied to the skin. Carrier oils will reduce skin sensitivity and also increase absorption through skin tissue. There are several different carrier oils from which you may choose, including:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Olive oil</li>
                   <li>Coconut oil</li>
                   <li>Jojoba oil</li>
                   <li>Almond oil</li>
                   <li>Avocado oil</li>
               </ul>
               <p>It's important to experiment, as different carrier oils may affect your skin differently. For instance, if you are using an essential oil to treat acne, test out a few different oils on a small section of your face to see how your skin reacts.</p>

              <p>An oil diffuser is a small device that can be placed on any surface of your home. It acts as a miniature humidifier, filling the room with steam or sonically induced water vapor.</p>
              <p>Simply fill the tank with water and add 10-15 drops of your favorite essential oil combination. As the water vapor “diffuses”, the fragrances will take over your home, allowing you to enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy while you go on with your daily routine.</p>
